<h1>Ciopillis</h1>

Ciopillis is a game written in c/c++ with the help of the raylib engine. In this wiki I will present mostly the CiopillisEngine - a system for card games written from scratch.

Note: to build the solution you have to install <a href="https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib">raylib</a> in your C:/raylib folder and build raylib.dll. I will upload soon the dll for anybody that wants to build fast and easy.

Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/firststef/Ciopillis/wiki">wiki</a> for more information.
